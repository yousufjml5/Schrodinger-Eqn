Schrödinger Equation Solver for Quarkonia Studies in QCD Research (applicable to general studies)

This repository contains a comprehensive solution to the Schrödinger equation, which is a fundamental aspect of quarkonia studies within Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) research. Quarkonia, bound states of heavy quark-antiquark pairs (such as charmonium and bottomonium), play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and related phenomena. Most of the time, the researchers assume a hydrogen atom wavefunction, which is based on the Coulomb potential. However, the correct one should be the Cornell wavefunction. Hence, solving the Schrödinger equation in this context helps researchers investigate the binding energies, dissociation temperatures, and spectral properties of quarkonia in the QGP medium. The Sch_WF_comparison_QQ_Hydrogen.ipynb, is the first code here where we have taken the vacuum Cornell potential. Our focus is to show a comparison of the Quarkonia wavefunction considering the Coulomb potential/Cornell Potential and compare it with the hydrogen atom wavefunction to show the difference.

Key Features

The program is primarily designed to run seamlessly in Jupyter Notebook environments, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for visualisation and analysis. Additionally, the code can be executed in a standard Python environment without any modification, making it highly versatile for various use cases.

2. Data Visualisation and Result Management:

The solver not only computes numerical results but also automatically generates high-quality visualisations of wave functions,    potential profiles. All generated images and numerical output are saved systematically in dedicated directories, ensuring a well-organised workflow.

3. Open-Source Contribution:

This tool is particularly valuable for theoretical physicists and computational researchers focusing on quarkonia studies and the quark-gluon plasma. Its modular design and robust output handling make it a powerful addition to the toolkit of anyone working in the field of high-energy nuclear physics.
